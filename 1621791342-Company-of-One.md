not all growth is beneficial, and some growth can actually reduce your
resilience and your autonomy.

More is generally the easiest answer, but not the smartest.

The first trait that resilient people have is an acceptance of reality.
They don’t need for things to be a certain way and don’t engage in wishful
thinking. Instead of imagining “if only this changed, I could thrive,” they have
a down-to-earth view that most of what happens in our lives is not entirely
within our control and the best we can do is to steer the boat a little as we
float down the river of life.

The second characteristic of resilient people is a sense of
purpose—being motivated by a sense of meaning rather than by just money.
Although purpose and money are not mutually exclusive, you’re more likely to be
resilient when you know that even in awful or stressful situations, you’re
working toward a greater and larger good.

Companies of one know that they can enjoy their work without always
enjoying every aspect of it.

The last trait of resilient people in a company of one is the ability
to adapt when things change—because they invariably do.

These industry disruptions or market changes aren’t a sky-is-falling
scenario—they’re truly just opportunities to redefine work and adapt to changes.

Often when you start working for yourself you trade micromanaging
bosses for micromanaging clients.

If you have an idea for starting a business that requires a lot of
money, time, or resources, you’re most likely thinking too big. Your idea can be
scaled down to the basics—do it now, do it on the cheap, and do it quickly—and
then iterated upon. Start without automation or infrastructure or overhead.
Start by helping one customer. Then another. This puts your focus on helping
people immediately with what you’ve got available to you right now. Work on
things like sales funnels and automation when it no longer makes sense to
personalize your interactions with your customers in surprising and delightful
ways.

As much as we don’t want to be, or admit to being, guided by external
factors and peer pressure in setting goals, to some degree we are.

Customer education—providing an audience with the knowledge, skills,
and abilities to become an informed buyer—is one of the most important parts of
a sales cycle.

there are three aspects of trust: confidence (“I believe what you
say”), competence (“I believe you have the skills to do what you say”), and
benevolence (“I believe you’re acting on my behalf”).

every minute you spend getting set up and started is a minute when you
aren’t making money.

The cofounder of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, has said that if you aren’t
embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.

Or as Austin Kleon cleverly puts it, “People want to be the noun
without doing the verb.”

The harder—much harder—part is making the dream happen every day.

Page: 203    
Just like Alex Franzen in Chapter 4, I’d start by finding a single
person to offer my knowledge to. Then another. And another.

Page: 205    
I’ve simply used my skills to help others, because I enjoy doing it.
And I’ve offered this help for free, in small doses at first, and then later for
good money in larger doses.
