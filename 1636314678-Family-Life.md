We no longer live in a world where everyone knows what “one” does and thereby what is “right” and “wrong.” Just a generation ago we lived in relatively isolated communities characterized largely by a values-related consensus that essentially was morally based. What does one do and what not? What is a duty and what should we do?
                
Note:Преди глобализацията и Интернета: Малки общности, споделящи едни и същи ценности и морални постулати, възпитани в един и същи морал от поколения. Съответно средата поддържа авторитета на родителите и родителите винаги могат да намерят подкрепа за изискванията си към децата си в морала, ценностите и представите за приемливо и неприемливо, споделян от всички в общността.

For my parents and their contemporaries, this knowledge of what one does was a great support, which was further strengthened by one of their own principal values: one does not deviate from what one does.

To a great extent, the Church in many countries finds it difficult to formulate its otherwise very good values in ways which resonate with people and make good common sense.

If we analyze which values dominate the structures of our society, the answer will be: the market’s values.

Parents must find the authority within themselves, and that is what is called values.
                
Note:В наши дни има твърде много авторитети извън родителите, които се конкурират за уважението на децата с авторитета на родителите, вместо го да утвърждават и подкрепят. Родителите вече не могат да разчитат на обществото или институциите извън семейството да усилват и да работят за родителския авторитет, нито дори да се надяват, че  те ще работят в синхрон с тях и в една посока, за най-доброто за детето.

Values are not the same as goals. They exist both before and after the goal has been met. The values describe our journey towards that goal and the qualities of that journey rather than the goal itself.

Equal dignity in a relationship therefore means that the wishes of both, their opinions and needs, are treated with the same gravity by the community and are not rejected or put down with reference to gender, age or disability. What you say is valuable to the community simply because you are you, because you are a human being and because you are an important part of this relation. With this approach, equal dignity refers to all people’s fundamental need to be seen, heard and taken seriously as individuals.

To feel treated with equal dignity is the opposite of being talked down to, lectured to, voted down, labeled or made fun of. It has nothing to do with niceness or reason. We can certainly treat each other with equal dignity—even when we are furious or sad. Nothing prevents us from doing that—except perhaps if we are not able to treat ourselves with dignity.

Equal dignity primarily expresses itself through language. A dialog which is based on equal dignity is a conversation in which both parties express themselves, their own thoughts, values, feelings, dreams and goals instead of theoriing or talking about each other.
                
Това е много важно: не теоретизираш и не генерализираш, както и не коментираш и не се опитваш да тълкуваш другия, неговите мотиви, емоции, усещания и опит! Говориш само и единствено за собствените си мотиви, емоции и собствените си усещания и опит в ситуацията
